# van Emde Boas Tree

This project examines the van Emde Boas tree (vEB), a high performance data structure that supports operations in $O(log(log(u)))$ time by using a fixed-universe recursive design. A custom implementation of the vEB tree is developed to investigate its actual performance across a range of input sizes. Empirical results are collected and compared with theoretical bounds to assess the viability of the data structure in practice. Findings demonstrate that while the structure's complexity may hinder widespread use, it remains a powerful tool in scenarios requiring rapid integer-based queries.
